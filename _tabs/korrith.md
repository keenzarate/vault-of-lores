<h2>The Hollow Flame</h2>

<p>
Korrith sa Val'Suin was born into the scorched legacy of a Black Dragonborn war clan—descendants of fire and fang, trained from birth to conquer, destroy, and obey. His people told stories of the <strong>Fang of Val'Suin</strong>, a relic forged from the tooth of the first black dragon and hardened by a cursed stone. It was said to be a weapon of annihilation, a symbol of their power.
</p>

<p>
Korrith was expected to carry that flame forward. But on one fateful raid, high in the cliffs above a silent valley, something broke the rhythm.
</p> 

<p>
While the others pressed onward, Korrith lingered alone at the mountain’s edge. No screams. No fire. Just stillness. The wind moved gently. The world was... quiet.
</p>

<p>
It wasn’t peace—he didn’t know what peace felt like. It was simply unfamiliar. A sensation he had no name for, but couldn’t forget.
</p>

<p>
That moment stayed with him.
</p>

<p>
When he refused to return to the clan’s path of ruin, they branded him a traitor. He wandered, alone, haunted by something he didn’t understand. Until he found the <strong>Thunn'Kel Monastery</strong>, a hidden refuge deep in the mountains of Agvarru. The monks there moved like shadows and breathed like the rivers -— fluid, focused, free.

<h2>The Whispers in Sulvaturr</h2>

<p>
There, in the shadowed halls of Thuun'Kel, carved into the cliffs above the world, Korrith began again—not as a warrior, but as an initiate.

His days started before sunrise, when the mountain mist was thick and the only sound was breath. He practiced stillness before movement, silence before speech. The monks of Thuun’Kel taught him to walk without leaving a trace, to strike without anger, and to observe without judgment.

He trained in the ancient form known as Kel’Zara—The Step Within Breath. Movements so precise they left no sound, no ripple of air, no shadow longer than a heartbeat. A motion that required his body to vanish, not by force, but by surrendering to the space around him.

He studied the Veins of Discipline, tracing inner power not through rage, but through restraint. And most difficult of all, he trained in the art of disappearing—not through magic, but through absolute presence.

When he failed, the monks said nothing. Their silence taught more than their words.

In time, Korrith’s flame did not vanish—it steadied. He no longer feared his shadow. He shaped it.

And in those long meditations, when his mind was still, the whispers returned.

Not in words—but in rhythm, in feeling. Sulvaturr stirring again in the corners of his breath.
</p>


<p>
Not a voice. Not a vision. Just the faint echo of a language that stirred something ancient in his blood. It was familiar, yet unknown. The language of his bloodline: <strong>Sulvaturr</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The whispers returned night after night, fragments of something long buried. The more he cultivated his practice, his breath, his form, and his focus, the more vivid they became.
</p>

<p>
Whispers turned to phrases.<br/>
Darkness gave way to images.<br/>
And slowly, the vision began to take shape:<br/>
A dagger—curved, fanged, glowing faintly from within.<br/>
The <strong>Fang of Val'Suin</strong>.<br/>
Calling to him.
</p>

<h2>The Bard’s Song</h2>

<p>
His journey led him to a distant town, where he crossed paths with a small band of travelers. One evening, as they rested near a low-burning fire, a bard plucked a haunting tune from his strings.

The moment the melody reached Korrith’s ears, he froze. The notes carried the same cadence as the whispers from his meditations—the same rise and fall, the same ache of something ancient and lost.

The language in the song wasn’t one he fully understood. But it sounded familiar, echoing the same syllables that had stirred in his blood night after night.

It was Sulvaturr. Not spoken—but sung.
</p>

<p>
He didn’t know what it meant yet, only that it mattered.
